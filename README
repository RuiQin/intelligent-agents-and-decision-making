This repository contains my projects for course Intelligent Agents and Decision Making: 

1. Finite-Horizon
Implement Markov Decision Process (MDP) models for finite horizon problems

2. Infinite-Horizon
Implement MDP models for infinite horizon problems

3. Bandit-Algorithms
Implement three bandit algorithms: Incremental Uniform, UCB, epsilon-Greedy and use them on different bandits

4. Reinforcement-Learning
Implement a model-free reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning

5. Pacman (final project)
